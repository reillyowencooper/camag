# MAGweaver

Work in progress tool for metagenome-assembled genomes. The end goal for this project is a complete workflow for crafting better MAGs from an initial set of MAGs and the associated reads. Ideally, some of those MAGs will be able to resolved into complete MAGs (CMAGs), then converted to genome-scale metabolic models.

*NOTE: This is in the fledgling stages, with no workable parts yet - just the framework of a few classes.*
